There are two kinds of things that can be done:
refactorings (think of jogging in the morning, going to a spa, well make the code better :)
new features (go to law school, get a job, do something real)
Just a joke - pick yourself a task and work on it.

==Refactoring==
* validate HTML
* set up loading of default settings from inside the /forum dir
* automatic dependency checking for modules
* propose how to rename directory forum --> osqa
  without breaking things and keeping name of the project root
  named the same way - osqa

==New features==
Whoever wants - pick a feature from the WISH_LIST
add it here and start working on it
If you are not starting immediately - leave it on the wishlist :)

==Notes==
1)after this is done most new suggested features
  may be worked on easily since most of them
  only require editing view functions and templates

  However, anyone can work on new features anyway - you'll
  just have to probably copy-paste your code into 
  the branch undergoing refactoring which involves 
  splitting the files. Auto merging across split points
  is harder or impossible.
